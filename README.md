## Overview  
A utility for converting [Suear "smart" earwax cleaner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.i4season.bkCamera) video streams to MJPEG for general-purpose use.  

**NOTE:** This tool has only been tested with the [LEIPUT X6](https://www.amazon.com/Ear-Wax-Removal-Remover-Android%EF%BC%88Black%EF%BC%89/dp/B09KZ8TS7L), but it should work for any product that uses `libWifiCamera.so` and/or the Suear mobile app (`com.i4season.bkCamera` - [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.i4season.bkCamera)/[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/suear/id1567383367)/[Direct APK download](https://web.archive.org/web/20230117012623/http://120.79.9.129/ypc/apk/Suear_V1.1.086.apk)) for video streaming in its client implementation.

## Usage  

 * Power on the Suear device  
 * Connect to the Suear WiFi  
 * Start the stream mirror: `python3 suear_mirror.py --no-ssl`  

With the stream mirror running, you can view the live video in a number of ways:  

 * In a web browser; navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:45100`  
 * In VLC (GUI); go to *Media*→*Open Network Stream...*, set the URL to `http://127.0.0.1:45100/stream`, and then click *Play*  
 * In VLC (command-line); run `vlc http://127.0.0.1:45100/stream`  
 * With ffmpeg; run `ffplay -i http://127.0.0.1:45100/stream`  


## SSL/TLS    

The video stream can also be transported over TLS for security. This document won't walk you through setting up your own [PKI](https://myhomelab.gr/linux/2019/12/13/local-ca-setup.html), but the following command will generate a key pair for encrypting traffic with TLS:  

```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -out cert.crt -keyout private.key
```

To start the stream mirror over HTTPS, specify the TLS key pair in the shell command:  

```
python3 suear_mirror.py cert.crt private.key
```

The HTTPS stream will then be accessible at `https://127.0.0.1:45100/stream`.
